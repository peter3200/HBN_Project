# HBN_Project

## Organization
Scripts are organized in the following folders: Image processing, analysis. All atlases and templates referenced are disseminated on the NITRC Downloads page for Auto_EACSF: https://www.nitrc.org/projects/auto_eacsf/. README files can be found in each folder, so please see these for additional details.

## Contact
Coding is not our primary expertise--but if you have questions concerning script usage, please contact us through our lab webpage: https://brain.byu.edu/contact. Any questions regarding Auto_EACSF should be sent to the NITRC forum page. Best of luck!
